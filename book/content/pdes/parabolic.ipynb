    "A classic example of a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) is the one-dimensional unsteady heat equation:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial t^2} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $T(x,t)$ is the temperature varying in space and time, and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity: $\\alpha = k / (\\rho c_p)$, which is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this using finite differences to represent the spatial derivatives and time derivatives separately.\n",
    "First, let's rearrange the PDE slightly:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\n",

    "Let's use a *central difference* for the spatial derivative with a spacing of $\\Delta x$, and a *forward difference* for the time derivative with a time-step size of $\\Delta t$. With these choices, we can obtain an approximation to the PDE that applies at time $t^k$ and spatial location $x_i$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{T_{i-1}^k - 2 T_i^k + T_{i+1}^k}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{T_i^{k+1} - T_i^k}{\\Delta t} \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $T_i^k$ is the temperature at time $t^k$ and spatial location $x_i$. The following figure shows the stencil of points involved in the PDE, for a domain with five points in the $x$-direction.\n",

    "To solve the heat equation for a one-dimensional domain over $0 \\leq x \\leq L$, we will need both initial conditions at $t = 0$ and boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$ (for all time). In terms of our nodal values, this means we need $T_i^{k=1}$ for $i = 1 \\ldots n$, where $n$ is the number of points, as well as information about $T_1^k$ and $T_n^k$ for all times $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rearrange the above equation to obtain our recursion formula:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "T_i^{k+1} = \\left( T_{i+1}^k + T_{i-1}^k \\right) \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2} + T_i^k  \\left( 1 - 2 \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2} \\right) \\;.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This is an **explicit** scheme in time, similar to the Forward Euler method we used for ordinary differential equations, and like that method it may have stability issues. The combination of terms we see repeated is also known as the Fourier number: $\\text{Fo} = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}$, and governs the stability.\n",
    "We can rewrite the recursion formula using this:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "T_i^{k+1} = \\left( T_{i+1}^k + T_{i-1}^k \\right) \\text{Fo} + T_i^k  \\left( 1 - 2 \\text{Fo} \\right) \\;.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The term in parentheses there must be greater than or equal to zero for stability ($1 - 2 \\text{Fo} \\geq 0$); if not, the solution may become unstable and blow up. This gives us some conditions on our choice of step sizes:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "1 - 2 \\text{Fo} &\\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "1 & \\geq 2 \\text{Fo} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Fo} &\\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2} &\\leq \\frac{1}{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "This is the stability criterion for the explicit method: the Fourier number must be smaller than 0.5.\n",
    "For a given thermal diffusivity and chosen spatial step size, this also gives us the limit on the time-step size: $\\Delta t \\leq \\Delta x^2 / (2 \\alpha)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example where the initial temperature is 200, the temperature at the boundaries are 50, the thermal diffusivity is $\\alpha = 2.3 \\times 10^{-1}$ m$^2 /$ s, and $L = 1$. \n",
