<p>Boundary-value problems are also ordinary differential equationsâ€”the difference is that our two constraints are at boundaries of the domain, rather than both being at the starting point.</p>
<p>For example, consider the ODE
\begin{equation}
y^{\prime\prime} + xy^{\prime} - xy = 2x
\end{equation}
with the boundary conditions $y(0)=1$ and $y(2)=8$.</p>
<p>The numerical methods we have already discussed (e.g., Forward Euler, Runge-Kutta) require values of $y$ and $y^{\prime}$ at the starting point, $x=0$. So we can't use these directly because we are missing $y^{\prime}(0)$.</p>
<p>But, what if we could <em>guess</em> a value for the missing initial condition, then integrate towards the second boundary condition using one of our familiar numerical methods, and then adjust our guess if necessary and repeat? This concept is the <strong>shooting method</strong>.</p>
