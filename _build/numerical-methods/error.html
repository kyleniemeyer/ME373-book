<p>Applying the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule introduces the concept of <strong>error</strong> in numerical solutions.</p>
<p>In our work so far, we have come across two obvious kinds of error, that we'll come back to later:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>local truncation error</strong>, which represents how "wrong" each interval/step is compared with the exact solution; and</li>
<li><strong>global truncation error</strong>, which is the sum of the truncation errors over the entire method.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any numerical solution, there are five main sources of error:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Error in input data: this comes from measurements, and can be <em>systematic</em> (for example, due to uncertainty in measurement devices) or <em>random</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rounding errors: loss of significant digits. This comes from the fact that computers cannot represent real numbers exactly, and instead use a floating-point representation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Truncation error: due to an infinite process being broken off. For example, an infinite series or sum ending after a finite number of terms, or discretization error by using a finite step size to approximate a continuous function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Error due to simplifications in a mathematical model: <em>"All models are wrong, but some are useful"</em> (George E.P. Box) All models make some idealizations, or simplifying assumptions, which introduce some error with respect to reality. For example, we may assume gases are continuous, that a spring has zero mass, or that a process is frictionless.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Human error and machine error: there are many potential sources of error in any code. These can come from typos, human programming errors, errors in input data, or (more rarely) a pure machine error. Even textbooks, tables, and formulas may have errors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Absolute-and-relative-error">Absolute and relative error<a class="anchor-link" href="#Absolute-and-relative-error"> </a></h3><p>We can also differentiate between <strong>absolute</strong> and <strong>relative</strong> error in a quantity. If $y$ is an exact value and $\tilde{y}$ is an approximation to that value, then we have</p>
<ul>
<li>absolute error: $\Delta y = | \tilde{y} - y |$</li>
<li>relative error: $\frac{\Delta y}{y} = \left| \frac{\tilde{y} - y}{y} \right|$</li>
</ul>
<p>If $y$ is a vector, then we can define error using the maximum of the elements:
\begin{equation}
\max_i \frac{ |y_i - \tilde{y}_{i} |}{|y_i|}
\end{equation}</p>
