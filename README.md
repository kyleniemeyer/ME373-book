# ME373-book

This repository contains an electronic textbook for the course ME 373, Mechanical Engineering Methods, taught at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu) by [Prof. Kyle Niemeyer](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/people/kyle-niemeyer).

The catalog description for this course is
> Analytical and numerical methods for solving representative mechanical engineering problems.
and the course learning objectives are:

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Formulate and solve mechanical engineering initial value problems of practical interest represented by first and second order differential equations using both analytical and explicit numerical methods.
2. Formulate and solve mechanical engineering boundary value problems of practical interest repre- sented by first and second order differential equations using both analytical and explicit numerical methods.
3. Formulate and numerically solve partial differential equations.
4. Identify and implement the most appropriate numerical method for solving a specific type of engi- neering problem. In addition, be able to recognize the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of numerical methods.

This course combines analytical solutions to differential equations with numerical solution approaches, heavily relying on Matlab.
